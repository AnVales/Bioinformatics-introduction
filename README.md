Some scripts for introduction to bioinformatics

- exercise_1.1.py: With this python script it is possible to find a subsequence and determine the number of times that it appears in the chain and the positions of the first element of the subsequence. Also, the script can determine the number of nucleotides that are between two subsequences.

- exercise_1.2.py: In this exercise, with a python script the frequency of each nucleotid (A/T/C/G) in a sequence is going to be indicated.
