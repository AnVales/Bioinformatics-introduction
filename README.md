# 🧬 Bioinformatics Introduction

This repository contains exercises on **nucleotide analysis** using Python, including:

- 🔹 **Exercise 1.1** – Search for substrings in a nucleotide chain and determine their positions.
- 🔹 **Exercise 1.2** – Calculate the frequency of nucleotides (A, C, G, T) in a given chain.

## 📝 Example Output

**Exercise 1.1**  
- Substrings found with their positions  
- Distance (in nucleotides) between specific substrings  

**Exercise 1.2**  
- Frequency (%) of each nucleotide in the chain  
- Verification that total adds up to 100%  

## 🐍 Scripts

- `exercise_1.1.py` – Substring search and positions  
- `exercise_1.2.py` – Nucleotide frequency calculation  

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python exercise_1.1.py
python exercise_1.2.py
